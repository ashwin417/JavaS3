[Employee.java](https://github.com/ashwin417/JavaS3/blob/main/Cycle4/Employee.java) - Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the                                        following members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'print-Salary( )' which prints the salary of                                the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data                                      members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a                                  manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.


[shapesides.java](https://github.com/ashwin417/JavaS3/blob/main/Cycle4/shapesides.java) - Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty
method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle
and Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of
the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of
sides in the given geometrical structures.

[Emeng.java](https://github.com/ashwin417/JavaS3/blob/main/Cycle4/Emeng.java) - Write two Java classes Employee and Engineer. Engineer should inherit from
Employee class. Employee class to have two methods display() and calcSalary().
Write a program to display the engineer salary and to display from Employee class
using a single object instantiation (i.e., only one object creation is allowed).

a. display() only prints the name of the class and does not return any value. Ex. “Name of class is Employee.”

b. calcSalary() in Employee displays “Salary of employee is 10000” and
calcSalary() in Engineer displays “Salary of employee is 20000.”
